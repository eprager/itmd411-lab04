Improve the program for Bank of IIT to help in deciphering whom from its records should be exclusive to premium loans versus those offered micro or less premium loans.

A database is used to store then present Loan analysis information from your data BankRecords objects from prior labs.  Three additional files were added

•	DBConnect.java to allow an object to connect / close a database connection.

•	Dao.java where Dao stands for Data Access Object. This will allow for database connectivity and CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) like operations.

•	LoanProcessing.java acts as a driver file (i.e., includes main function) to call the database CRUD methods and create some resulting output.
